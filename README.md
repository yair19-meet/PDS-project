# Programming for Data Science: European Cities Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes cities in Europe, comparing them across multiple dimensions such as:
- Salary
- Cost of living
- GDP
- And more

The complete analysis is included in the **Jupyter Notebook** `main.ipynb`, which contains:
- Data wrangling and initial analysis
- An interactive map
- An interactive dashboard to display data clearly and intuitively

We also provide the **interactive dashboard as a `.py` file**, in case running it inside the notebook is not optimal.

## Dependencies
To run the notebook and dashboard, the following Python libraries are required:
- BeautifulSoup
- requests
- coordinate-parser
- Dash
- Matplotlib
- mplcursors
- Numpy
- Pandas
- rapidfuzz
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- lxml

> The notebook includes an option to install missing libraries automatically.

## Notes
We encourage you to explore the data and interact with the plots.
